# Class-Project
This is a class project that I created during my big data programming class as a graduate student. We had to analyze datasets based on the hypothesis we chose and we had to prove or disprove our hypothesis using the datasets. 
# Hypothesis
"It is better to be safe than sorry"
# Why did I choose these datasets to analyze for my hypothesis?
 I chose these datasets because since my hypothesis is it is better to be safe than sorry I chose to do analyze diabetes deaths per state, traffic violations, personal income, and occupant deaths and alcohol impaired driving deaths datasets.
1. I chose diabetes deaths per state because to show why it is important to take care of your diabetes , by keeping track of sugar levels and always going to get it checked it is better to be safe than not caring about your medication or any way to prevent diabetic from harming your body or turning to death. 
2. I chose traffic violations dataset because to show why it is important to obey the laws on the road , it is better to be safe and always obey the laws than being sorry when an accident occurs or any incidents that can put you in prison for life or lead to you or someone death
3. I chose personal income dataset because to show why it is important and safe to have money set aside for emergencies that are not unexpected , than being sorry for not having money needed in a situation that only money can fix. 
4. I chose occupant and alcohol impaired driving deaths dataset because to show why it is important to never be distrcted while on the road such as using your phone to text or call and doing other things and also to never drink alcohol and drive because thye can both lead to deaths, being in prison for life, causing harm or death to someone else. So it is always safer to obey the laws and drive with care than being sorry at the end when an avoidable situation happens.
